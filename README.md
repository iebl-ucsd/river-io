# River I/O

This is an Open Ephys GUI plugin that streams spikes and events using the [River library](https://pbotros.github.io/river/docs/intro.html). River is a C++ framework that allows simple, schemaâ€™d streaming of data, without any compromises on latency or throughput. It requires a connection to a [Redis](https://redis.io/) database in order to work.

This plugin was developed by Paul Botros in the Carmena Lab at UC Berkeley. See [this fork](https://github.com/carmenalab/plugin-GUI/) of the GUI for the original implementation.
